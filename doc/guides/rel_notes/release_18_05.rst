  The BCM58800 devices feature a NetXtreme E-Series advanced network controller, a high-performance
  ARM CPU block, PCI Express (PCIe) Gen3 interfaces, key accelerators for compute offload and a high-
  speed memory subsystem including L3 cache and DDR4 interfaces, all interconnected by a coherent
  Network-on-chip (NOC) fabric.

  The ARM CPU subsystem features eight ARMv8 Cortex-A72 CPUs at 3.0 GHz, arranged in a multi-cluster
  configuration.

API Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain API changes. Sample format:

   =========================================================

* meter: updated to accommodate configuration profiles.

  The meter API is changed to support meter configuration profiles. The
  configuration profile represents the set of configuration parameters
  for a given meter object, such as the rates and sizes for the token
  buckets. These configuration parameters were previously the part of meter
  object internal data strcuture. The separation of the configuration
  parameters from meter object data structure results in reducing its
  memory footprint which helps in better cache utilization when large number
  of meter objects are used.


ABI Changes
-----------

.. This section should contain ABI changes. Sample format:

   * Add a short 1-2 sentence description of the ABI change that was announced
     in the previous releases and made in this release. Use fixed width quotes
     for ``rte_function_names`` or ``rte_struct_names``. Use the past tense.
